# The Investigation Nobody Could Answer — Backend

An agentic incident-investigation backend. Given a natural-language question
about an internal engineering incident, it runs a multi-step LangGraph
investigation (analyze → search → analyze evidence → detect contradictions →
compare against history → decide if more evidence is needed → answer) over a
document corpus, and returns an evidence-backed answer with a trace of what
it did.

This is a hackathon-scoped implementation: one working investigation graph,
real hybrid retrieval, real contradiction/timeline/similar-incident analysis,
and a clean `/investigate` API — not a sprawling framework.

## Architecture

```
FastAPI  POST /investigate
        │
        ▼
 analyze_question  (LLM extracts service/date/version/symptoms/targets)
        │
        ▼
     search  <───────────────────────────┐   hybrid retrieval:
        │                                │     - semantic (Chroma + sentence-transformers)
        ▼                                │     - metadata (SQLite filters)
 analyze_evidence (timeline + gap/LLM)   │     - merged, deduped, re-ranked
        │                                │
        ▼                                │
 detect_contradictions (LLM)             │
        │                                │
        ▼                                │
 similar_incidents (LLM classification:  │
   same / similar / related / unrelated) │
        │                                │
        ▼                                │
 need more evidence? ──yes──▶ expand_queries (LLM query expansion) ──▶ search
        │no
        ▼
 generate_answer (LLM: answer + confidence, grounded in evidence)
        │
        ▼
     JSON response
```

The loop is capped at `MAX_INVESTIGATION_ITERATIONS` (default 3) to prevent
runaway searching. Every LLM call is isolated behind `app/llm/client.py`, so
the model can be swapped without touching agent logic, and every retrieval
call goes through controlled Python functions in `app/retrieval/` — the LLM
never touches SQL or the vector store directly.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.11+ and network access to install dependencies and download
the embedding model on first run.

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Ingest the example documents

```bash
python -m app.ingestion.documents --reset
```

This loads `data/documents.json`, validates each record, stores metadata +
content in SQLite (`data/app.db`), chunks each document, generates local
embeddings (`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`, via sentence-transformers — no external
embedding API), and indexes the chunks in Chroma (`data/chroma/`). Re-running
it is idempotent (SQLite upserts by `document_id`; Chroma chunk ids are
deterministic).

### Run the API

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

### Run tests

```bash
pytest
```

The test suite covers chunking, SQLite metadata filtering, hybrid-ranking
helper functions, LangGraph node/decision logic, and the API layer. LLM calls
are monkeypatched in `test_investigation.py` / `test_api.py` so the suite runs
deterministically without a live `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; retrieval logic is
exercised directly against a temporary SQLite database.

> **Note on this delivery environment:** the sandbox this code was written in
> has no network access, so dependencies could not actually be `pip install`ed
> or executed here to run `pytest`/`uvicorn` live. The code was written
> carefully against the documented APIs of FastAPI, LangGraph, the Anthropic
> SDK, sentence-transformers, and ChromaDB, and checked with `python -m
> py_compile` for syntax errors, but you should run `pytest` yourself after
> `pip install -r requirements.txt` to confirm behavior in your environment,
> and fix up any small API-version mismatches (e.g. if you pin different
> `langgraph`/`chromadb` versions than `requirements.txt`).

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t incident-agent .
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 incident-agent
```

The container runs ingestion on startup, then serves the API at
`http://localhost:8000`. Or with compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## API

### `GET /health`

```json
{"status": "ok"}
```

### `POST /investigate`

Request:

```json
{"question": "Why did the Order API become slow on September 16? Check whether the deployment was related and whether we have seen this before."}
```

Example `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/investigate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Why did the Order API become slow on September 16? Check whether the deployment was related and whether we have seen this before."}'
```

Example response (shape; exact wording depends on the live LLM):

```json
{
  "answer": "The evidence indicates that the September 16 latency spike on orders-api was temporally associated with deployment v2.8.1. INC-1042 reports the P95 latency increase beginning shortly after the release, and DEP-882 records that v2.8.1 (which changed connection pooling configuration) was deployed at 18:10 UTC the previous day; ENG-DISC-19 notes that connection wait-time metrics correlated with the spike. A previous latency incident is documented in PM-211 (2026-05-03, v2.6.0), but it was caused by database connection saturation during a schema migration - a different mechanism. The documents support that a similar latency incident occurred before, but do not establish that it shared the same root cause. Confidence: medium.",
  "confidence": "medium",
  "evidence": [
    {
      "document_id": "INC-1042",
      "title": "Order API latency spike",
      "type": "incident_report",
      "date": "2026-09-16",
      "version": "v2.8.1",
      "content": "P95 latency increased significantly on the orders-api service starting on 2026-09-16..."
    }
  ],
  "contradictions": [],
  "trace": [
    "Parsed question: orders-api, 2026-09-16, slow, latency.",
    "Planned initial search queries: ['orders-api latency September 16 deployment', 'orders-api previous latency incidents'].",
    "Searched \"orders-api latency September 16 deployment\" -> found 5 result(s), 5 new: INC-1042, DEP-882, ENG-DISC-19, CUST-77, ARCH-05.",
    "Built timeline from 4 dated document(s).",
    "No significant evidence gaps identified.",
    "No contradictions detected among current evidence.",
    "Compared current evidence against 1 other document(s) for historical similarity: PM-211=similar_incident.",
    "Generated final evidence-backed answer with confidence=medium."
  ]
}
```

## The three required test scenarios

The bundled `data/documents.json` contains documents for all three scenarios
from the spec:

- **A — deployment-related incident**: `INC-1042` / `DEP-882` / `PM-211`
  (plus supporting `ENG-DISC-19`, `CUST-77`, `ARCH-05`). Ask: *"Why did the
  Order API become slow on September 16? Check whether the deployment was
  related and whether we have seen this before."*
- **B — contradictory guidance**: `GUIDE-12` (2024, restart) vs. `GUIDE-41`
  (2026, do not restart during dependency failures). Ask: *"The service is
  failing after a deployment. What should the on-call engineer do first?"*
- **C — insufficient evidence**: `INC-300` (catalog-api, database
  saturation) vs. `INC-301` (orders-api, expired certificate) — different
  services and failure mechanisms. Ask: *"Did this exact failure happen
  before?"* — the system should explicitly decline to claim a match rather
  than force one.

After ingesting, exercise these with `curl` against `POST /investigate` (or
`/docs` for interactive Swagger UI) to verify:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/investigate -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "The service is failing after a deployment. What should the on-call engineer do first?"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/investigate -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Did this exact failure happen before?"}'
```

## Design notes

- **Hybrid retrieval, not pure vector similarity** (`app/retrieval/hybrid.py`):
  merges semantic hits (Chroma) with metadata hits (SQLite), deduplicates by
  `document_id`, and re-ranks with a weighted score over semantic relevance,
  service match, version match, type match, date proximity to the question's
  anchor date, and general recency.
- **Query expansion is a real graph node** (`expand_queries_node`): after the
  first search + evidence analysis pass, an LLM call looks at what was
  actually discovered (e.g. a version number, a root cause keyword) and gaps
  identified by the gap-analysis step, and proposes new, more specific
  queries — this is what makes the system re-search based on findings rather
  than just running one retrieval pass.
- **Contradiction detection is evidence-grounded**: the LLM is explicitly
  instructed not to assume "newer supersedes older" unless the documents
  themselves indicate that relationship, and to output structured
  `{title, description}` pairs matching the API contract.
- **Similar-incident classification is a 4-way classification**
  (`same_incident` / `similar_incident` / `related_but_different` /
  `unrelated`), not a binary "is this the same" — matching the requirement
  that semantic similarity alone is never treated as proof of sameness.
- **Confidence is evidence-driven**: the final-answer prompt is explicit that
  `confidence` must reflect evidence quality (direct vs. indirect vs. no
  matching documents), and the code falls back to `"insufficient"` whenever
  no evidence was retrieved at all, regardless of what the model returns.
- **Everything the model can see is grounded**: evidence objects are always
  hydrated from SQLite (the source of truth for content/metadata), so the
  answer/contradiction/similar-incident prompts only ever receive real
  document content — nothing is synthesized before it reaches the LLM.
