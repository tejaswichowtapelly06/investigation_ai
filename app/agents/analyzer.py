Evidence Analyzer Agent.

Three responsibilities, matching the architecture diagram's "Evidence
Analyzer" branch (contradiction detection lives in agents/contradiction.py):

  1. Timeline Analysis   - deterministic, built from document dates (no LLM
                            invention of times/causality).
  2. Similar Incident     - LLM classifies retrieved documents relative to the
     Analysis               current incident as: same / similar / related /
                            unrelated, with justification grounded in the
                            documents' actual content.
  3. Gap Analysis / Loop  - LLM identifies unanswered investigation targets
     Decision                and whether another search round is warranted.

Classify each candidate document into exactly one category:
  - "same_incident": the document is clearly describing the exact same incident/event as the current one
  - "similar_incident": a different incident, but with meaningfully similar symptoms/service/failure mechanism
  - "related_but_different": touches the same service/area but a different failure mechanism or cause
  - "unrelated": not meaningfully connected

Base your classification ONLY on the actual content provided - service, symptoms, version, failure \
mechanism, affected component, root cause. Do NOT assume two incidents are the same just because they \
are semantically similar or involve the same service. Only classify as "same_incident" if the evidence \
clearly indicates they refer to the identical event (e.g. matching incident ID, matching exact date/time \
and description).
